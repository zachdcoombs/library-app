What started as a quick library app for some class practice turned into this. 

This is the most up to date version that I'm happy with. 

To do as of 7/18/22: 
    Copy theme to background html and cards for each book (blue, red, white, grey, dropshadows)
    Copy logic from v2 in to begin trying to bridge the two pieces together: 
        get input from text fields
        take that input and put it on to cards
        display cards
    On click of "new book" should open up current functional card
    Add "close x" to book card

    And I'm sure some other stuff I can't comprehend right now
